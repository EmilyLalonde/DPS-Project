#### Errors I ran into:

*"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <". Upon begining the project, I ran into this error after deploying to Github Pages. The error said that it was coming from App.vue but upon further investigation it was really coming from the index.html file. Because this is only my second project in Vue I turned to StackOverflow to find a solution.  

#### Tech Stack:
*Vue.js
*Vue Router
